# kup-layout

## About this component

This is a component used to improve some common layout necessities.

Basically is just a wrapper for a CSS Grid layout, therefore you can also customize it with other Grid properties
by simply declaring them on the component.

## Known issues

### Elements on a same line with overflow auto

On MacOs browsers, there is an issue involving the `horizontal` prop.

Basically, after having set that prop, if the single line elements would overflow the boundary of their parents
while forcing the the CSS property `overflow: auto;` on the container, the browser does not add the scrollbars,
making it impossible to horizontally scroll the container.

More about this issue inside the SCSS file of this component.

## Properties

| Property                   | Attribute                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Type      | Default |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------- |
| `columnsNumber`            | `columns-number`              | Specifies how many columns the content must be organized onto.  If this is greater than 1, then the horizontal prop will have no effect.                                                                                      | `number`  | `1`     |
| `contentBasedColumnsWidth` | `content-based-columns-width` | By default, columns size is calculated by the grid layout and it tries to give the same space to elements.  If this is true, columns width will be calculated according to the cells content. See SCSS file for more details. | `boolean` | `false` |
| `fillSpace`                | `fill-space`                  | When true, the layout and its contents will try to take all the available horizontal space.                                                                                                                                   | `boolean` | `false` |
| `horizontal`               | `horizontal`                  | Tells the layout to place all elements onto a single row. It does not work when columnsNumber is greater then 1.                                                                                                              | `boolean` | `false` |


## CSS Custom Properties

| Name                                              | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--lyo_column-number, --kup-layout_column-number` | Number of columns. This property is regulated by the columnsNumber property, but can be overridden by !important declarations. |
| `--lyo_grid-gap, --kup-layout_grid-gap`           | Space between two adjacent cells (on columns and rows).                                                                        |
